WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
In India, we are building a Ram temple, and there people are blowing up Pakistan with a bomb.

00:04.160 --> 00:09.560
And the people of Pakistan have great respect and affection for the people of Iran.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.120
Iran attacks Pakistan.

00:13.120 --> 00:17.960
I had not even dreamt that I would hear this news in 2024.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.600
But this is a fact.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.880
And that too when Jai Shankar ji met the leadership of Iran.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.040
Pakistan is not going to sit quietly.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.080
Pakistan will also give an answer to this.

00:28.160 --> 00:32.200
In fact, there is still news that they have already retaliated.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.280
War has reached us from Europe to Asia.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.160
This video is going to be quite different from our other videos.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.840
Because we are also very shocked.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.000
We want to understand what is happening.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.680
If you are also confused and want to know the possible reasons for this war,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.280
then watch this video till the end.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.520
We cover all the important events of the world for you.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.560
We bring them to you in simple language.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.080
Many of you have given us a lot of support in the last year.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.520
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.880
But if you have forgotten to click on that red subscribe button for any reason,

01:02.880 --> 01:05.640
then take 2 seconds and click on that button.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.720
Because it is free for you, but it gives us more courage to make new videos.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.080
Chapter 1. Why did Iran attack?

01:13.080 --> 01:17.960
After the Israel-Hamas war, if there is a country that has suddenly become very active,

01:17.960 --> 01:19.080
then it is Iran.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.440
Today Iran is in the news because they have attacked our dear neighbor Pakistan.

01:23.440 --> 01:30.240
Missiles and drones have hit two bases of Baluchi militant group Jaish-e-Adil on Pakistani territory.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.880
Some extremists of this terror group were hiding in Balochistan province of Pakistan.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.480
This is what Iran has to say.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.080
They attacked Iran last month, i.e. in December 2023.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.640
In which 11 police officers lost their lives.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.200
This attack happened near the border of Pakistan, in a town called Rask.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.640
Jaish-e-Adil was responsible for this attack.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.840
And this is not the only incident, friends.

01:52.840 --> 01:59.040
Last year, in the month of July, four police officers were killed by this group on the border of Pakistan and Iran.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.480
Who is this Jaish-e-Adil?

02:00.480 --> 02:04.160
This is a Sunni militant group that was formed in 2012.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.440
Today this group operates from Pakistan.

02:06.440 --> 02:10.440
For this group, Iran blames Pakistan and Pakistan blames Iran.

02:10.440 --> 02:15.400
Both countries say that they get militant activities from each other's soil to another country.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.440
Iran says that they get terrorist attacks from Pakistani soil.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.240
Even before this, Iran has taken such actions against terrorist groups.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.640
But this level of action has happened for the first time.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.040
And this is huge.

02:27.040 --> 02:34.440
The most dangerous thing is that IRGC's military actions have started near the borders of Pakistan in the south-east of Iran.

02:34.440 --> 02:39.640
Something similar to what Russia did on their border before attacking Ukraine.

02:39.640 --> 02:43.040
Now let's understand the reaction of Pakistan after these attacks.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.240
Chapter 2, Pakistan's reaction.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.240
During the attack, the Pakistani PM was in Davos for the World Economic Forum.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.240
After the attack, he came back to Pakistan.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.440
Pakistan is a democracy of name only.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.040
Not a single PM of Pakistan has completed his 5-year term.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.440
Every PM of Pakistan is a puppet PM.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.040
Pakistani military has complete control over their politics.

03:04.040 --> 03:09.040
In such a situation, if Iran attacks Pakistan, how will Pakistan remain silent?

03:09.040 --> 03:13.840
Islamabad called this attack illegal and said that there will be serious consequences.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.040
Pakistan says that not only terrorists, but their citizens have also been targeted.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.840
This attack on their sovereignty.

03:19.840 --> 03:25.440
In a way, Pakistan believes that there are terrorist groups attacking their soil in other countries.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.440
But there is nothing surprising in this.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.240
As a revenge, Pakistan attacked Iran's terrorist outfits.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.640
Pakistan says that their terrorists were killed in this attack.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.640
What is the logic behind this?

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Trust me bro, because Pakistan has an amazing superpower

00:03.840 --> 00:07.080
After being attacked by them, they get to know in a day

00:07.080 --> 00:09.280
where the terror outfits are in other countries

00:09.280 --> 00:11.480
And they can take action the very next day

00:11.480 --> 00:15.680
Yes, if it was any other country, they wouldn't have waited for the attack

00:15.680 --> 00:19.480
Iran is openly saying that they attacked Pakistan

00:19.480 --> 00:20.960
Not any terror group

00:20.960 --> 00:24.760
The funniest part is that the leaders of both the countries had just met

00:24.760 --> 00:28.040
If they had to solve things through dialogue, it could have been done there as well

00:28.120 --> 00:33.120
But Pakistan wants to portray that they too get terror attacks from other countries

00:33.120 --> 00:35.800
So that's why they invented a new terror group

00:35.800 --> 00:38.720
and also attacked Saistan and Baluchistan

00:38.720 --> 00:41.320
This attack is a very deadly message for Iran

00:41.320 --> 00:44.240
Because in 1988, the Iran-Iraq war ended

00:44.240 --> 00:49.160
This war lasted for 8 years and approximately 5 lakh people lost their lives

00:49.160 --> 00:52.640
After this, there was no rocket attack on Iran for so many years

00:52.640 --> 00:56.720
Now this is broken, and that too because Iran attacked first

00:56.720 --> 01:01.560
Pakistan says that there are many terror groups in Iran that secretly attack Pakistan

01:01.560 --> 01:05.760
The attack that Pakistan did on Iran, they have given it a very interesting name

01:05.760 --> 01:07.120
Margbar Sarmachar

01:07.120 --> 01:10.080
In Persian, Margbar means Death to

01:10.080 --> 01:12.240
and Sarmachar means Fighters

01:12.240 --> 01:15.040
In 1979, when the Islamic Revolution took place,

01:15.040 --> 01:19.200
this term was used against the people of the US and Israel

01:19.200 --> 01:23.000
And even today, Iran's relations with both these countries are very tense

01:23.000 --> 01:26.320
That is, Pakistan is openly calling Iran its enemy

01:26.320 --> 01:28.880
and is not taking this attack lightly at all

01:28.880 --> 01:32.120
Similarly, Iran shares its border with Balochistan

01:32.120 --> 01:35.560
Balochistan has been wanting to separate from Pakistan for a long time

01:35.560 --> 01:41.200
Pakistan has targeted the hideouts of the Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front

01:41.200 --> 01:44.720
At least, this is the story that Pakistan wants to tell the whole world

01:44.720 --> 01:49.960
This incident gives Pakistan an excuse to suppress their Balochistan revolution

01:49.960 --> 01:54.240
Whatever actions Pakistan takes in Balochistan, it can impose on Iran

01:54.280 --> 01:56.800
Because if Pakistan does not stop Balochistan,

01:56.800 --> 01:59.920
then it is possible that Pakistan will be divided into four parts in the future

01:59.920 --> 02:02.320
We have covered this point in a previous video

02:02.320 --> 02:04.360
Things are developing very fast

02:04.360 --> 02:08.080
And we know that Pakistan is not hesitating to retaliate

02:08.080 --> 02:09.840
Chapter 3 Side Effects of War

02:09.840 --> 02:12.680
Pakistan and Iran are both nuclear powers

02:12.680 --> 02:14.920
Both have very unstable leadership

02:14.920 --> 02:17.240
We have said before and will say again today that

02:17.240 --> 02:20.560
In a war, there are no winners, there are only losers

02:20.560 --> 02:22.400
Because both sides go to die

02:22.400 --> 02:24.600
Resources are wasted on both sides

02:24.600 --> 02:25.800
Trade is disrupted

02:25.800 --> 02:27.600
The relations are broken

02:27.600 --> 02:31.600
The whole world wants Iran and Pakistan not to fight with each other

02:31.600 --> 02:33.280
They understand the reaction of the world

02:33.280 --> 02:36.520
Even China has said that this should not be escalated

02:36.520 --> 02:41.680
Mao Ning, who is in China's foreign ministry, has also said that the problem should be solved through dialogue

02:41.680 --> 02:44.920
The United States has condemned Iran's missile strike

02:44.920 --> 02:48.800
And they have also said that Iran has not done this once, but repeatedly

02:48.800 --> 02:51.640
They have attacked Iraq and Syria

02:51.640 --> 02:55.600
For some reason, Iran has been trying to enter the war for a long time

02:55.600 --> 02:58.680
Before this, Iran has also attacked Syria and Iraq

02:58.680 --> 03:03.560
Iran actually controls a secret group called Axis of Resistance

03:03.560 --> 03:08.160
In which Yemen's Houthi rebels, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Hamas are also included

03:08.160 --> 03:11.840
Because of Gaza, Axis of Resistance is getting stronger again

03:11.840 --> 03:13.640
As if they are getting a purpose

03:13.640 --> 03:17.160
Anti-West sentiments are getting very strong in the Islamic world

03:17.160 --> 03:19.000
And this is quite dangerous

03:19.040 --> 03:23.440
On January 12, the UK and the US attacked Houthi targets in Yemen

03:23.440 --> 03:26.120
Because the Houthis were attacking commercial ships

03:26.120 --> 03:28.440
Which was having an impact on global trade

03:28.440 --> 03:32.600
Now it is possible that the attack on Pakistan is a message for the West

03:32.600 --> 03:35.720
That Iran is not afraid to wage war directly

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.340
Chapter 4 Conclusion

00:01.340 --> 00:05.840
From this whole incident, we get to learn a lot about the attitude of both the countries.

00:05.840 --> 00:11.540
If Iran is criticized, then Iran is already interfering in the war between Israel and Hamas.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.340
It is hijacking the trade ships of the US and UK.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.340
It is interrupting global trade.

00:16.340 --> 00:19.220
In this, India should not be unnecessarily harmed.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.420
India should not be involved in the conflicts of others.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.300
That's why Jai Shankar was in Tehran.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.840
But Iran has been becoming quite aggressive for the past few months.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.340
On the other hand, how did Pakistan get to know that there are terror groups in Iran after being attacked by Iran?

00:32.340 --> 00:37.140
If Iran itself says that they have attacked, then what is the need to look for a terror group?

00:37.140 --> 00:40.420
How can Pakistan take action before taking any investigation?

00:40.420 --> 00:43.000
This attack is less and a statement is more.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.640
That Pakistan is not weak.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.000
This message is not only for Iran, but also for the whole world.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.080
Even for India.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.300
That if India enters Pakistan in the name of surgical strikes, then this time Pakistan will also retaliate.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.920
Yes, we don't know how effective this retaliation will be.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.080
Here I really don't understand one thing.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.340
That Pakistan is not made up of Afghanistan, India, or Iran.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.420
It is made up of China only because they throw money.

01:08.420 --> 01:12.580
The western world says that Pakistan raises snakes.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.080
Their leaders call Osama a hero.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.300
He gives shelter to people of extremist ideology.

01:18.300 --> 01:24.460
In such a situation, if Pakistan says that terrorism has become a problem for them too, then what will the world think?

01:24.500 --> 01:28.460
The world will think that they are getting a taste of their own medicine.

01:28.460 --> 01:32.500
The snakes that they have raised, the same snakes are running to bite them.

01:32.500 --> 01:38.280
And that's why we, India, have to adopt the same strategy that we take care of our own interests.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.960
We have to play the game of geopolitics very carefully.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.280
So that we keep good relations with everyone.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.540
If we leave China today, then our relations with every big country are very strong.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.500
Russia is also our friend and so is America.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.620
We are also made up of Iran and Israel.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.580
That means India is playing the role of a neutral country very well.

01:55.580 --> 01:59.120
Today, the whole world needs this rational perspective.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.740
Because with this rationality, our economy is flourishing.

02:02.740 --> 02:05.860
Because we can control the impact of global events.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.440
We can manage trade.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
There is no winner in war.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.780
That's why we have to oppose war forever.

02:12.780 --> 02:17.480
Because somehow, directly or indirectly, war has an impact on us too.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.860
And now, war has come to our neighborhood.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.560
If you got some value from this video, if you got some clarity, then share it with your friends.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.520
On the global stage, we have to take care of our image and our relations.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.560
And Jai Shankar has played a very important role in this.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.360
We will definitely share a very important video about his contributions with you tomorrow.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.820
So make sure to subscribe.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.820
Because in geopolitics, there are no permanent friends, only temporary interests.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.140
And this is the important thing.

02:44.140 --> 02:46.940
It makes a difference to me to reach you.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.860
